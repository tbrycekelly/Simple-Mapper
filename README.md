# Simple Mapper
 A Simple mapping library for R. This library is self contained with some optional linkages to other libraries/datasets.

Inspiration for this project originated back in 2017 when we were first exploring options for mapping and visualizing spatial data in the R universe. What we found, and largely still find, was an ecosystem of GIS-centric libraries with far more horse-power than we needed.

Power is great, except when it comes with a learning curve and inflexibility. Finding the then current libraries unable to reliably spit out a map of our data points with clear cause-and-effect structures (e.g., do this to add an arrow or do this to add a label), we decided to build our own library suited to the task of making maps simpler.
